# XwhloThree JavaScript Code

This JavaScript code is part of the XwhloThree web application. It contains various functions that handle user interactions, scrolling, counters, and a countdown timer.

## Functionality

This JavaScript code provides the following functionality:

1. **Toggle Menu**: The `otherLinks` element can be clicked to toggle the visibility of the menu (`otherLinksMenu`). It adds or removes the "open" class on the menu and the "opend" class on the `otherLinksA` element.

2. **Global Click Listener**: A global click event listener ensures that when clicking outside the `otherLinksMenu` or `otherLinks`, the menu will close if it's currently open.

3. **Dynamic Year**: The year in the `.year` element is dynamically updated to the current year using JavaScript.

4. **Smooth Scrolling**: The `scrollTo` function allows smooth scrolling to different sections of the page when certain elements (`MenuIl`, `Menua`, `GoDown`, and `[upBotton]`) are clicked.

5. **Content Tab Switching**: Clicking on elements in the `tabsLi` array switches the displayed content and adds the "active" class to the clicked element.

6. **Animated Counters**: The `startCountOnScroll` and `startCounter` functions start counters when certain sections (`number` and `spnanumber`) are scrolled into view. The counters increment from 0 to a specified number with animation.

7. **Countdown Timer**: The code sets a countdown timer to a specified end date (`Feb 31, 2023 23:59:59`). It updates the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds in the appropriate HTML elements.
